project to create a simple one page website

from this exercise, weaknesses that I want to work on are:

1. learning more range in the property options for each css selector
2. getting faster with learning the syntax differences between languages (took too long to think through)
3. better planning on paper of structure of page 1st (I think it will help in understanding total idea cohesively)
4. work on better plan for how to attack tasks (too much jumping around between thoughts and tasks)
5. get a stronger understanding of manipulating the components of a content item (had to play and adjust margin, padding, etc. too much)
6. go over best practices for commenting (lack confidence I'm using them correctly)
7. really need to work on workflow (too way too long to complete because inefficient movement logically through code, between html and css, need better plan for order of operations and breaking the task down incrementally
