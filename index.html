        <section>
          <h3>My professional background...</h3>
          <p>I have a passion for web development and everything design-related. Software engineering 
          by nature feels like a truly endless quest to hone one's craft that will forever keep me engaged.</p> 
          <p>I learned early on in my professional life that leveraging the collective, cohesive effort of a 
          passionate team is very special and I strive to be a contributing member of that specific 
          kind of team.</p>
